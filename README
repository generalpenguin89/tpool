A simple (and as of yet incomplete) thread pool that can run many tasks.  The
thread pool is dynamic but with a fixed maximum size specified at startup time.

When initialized with tpool_init(), the thread pool will have 0 threads
running.  When a task is added to the pool with tpool_submit(), the pool will
spawn a thread for that task.  For subsequent tasks, if the pool has not
reached its maximum size, it will spawn a new thread; otherwise, it will
queue the task and an existing thread will take the task when it finishes a
previous task.

The thread pool may be shut down with tpool_shutdown(), in which case it will
refuse any new tasks.  All running and queued tasks will run to completion.
When they have run to completion, resources used by the thread pool can be
freed with tpool_destroy().
